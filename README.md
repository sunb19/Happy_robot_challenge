# 🚀 Features

# 🔐 Carrier Authentication

	•	Extract MC number from caller
	•	Validate via backend API (/auth-carrier)
	•	Simple FMCSA mock:
	•	Non-numeric → ineligible
	•	Starts with "9" → ineligible
	•	Others → eligible

# 📦 Load Search

	•	AI extracts load preferences
	•	POST /loads/search returns matching JSON loads
	•	Carrier hears lane, miles, rate, pickup time

# 💵 3-Round Automated Negotiation

POST /negotiate

	•	Round-based logic:
	•	Offer >= 95% → accept
	•	Offer <= 85% with round >= 3 → reject
	•	Otherwise → counter
	•	Designed for realistic freight brokerage negotiation rules

# 📞 Call Logging

POST /call-log

	•	Outcome
	•	Sentiment
	•	Rate agreed
	•	Summary

# 📊 Dashboard

GET /dashboard

	•	Total calls
	•	Accept / reject %
	•	Sentiment breakdown
	•	Average agreed rate
	•	Eligible / ineligible counts

# 🧠 HappyRobot Workflow Overview

Your Inbound Voice Agent follows this flow:

	1.	Extract MC → POST /auth-carrier
	2.	IF eligible → extract load info → POST /loads/search
	3.	Pitch load → extract offer → POST /negotiate (round 1)
	4.	Continue negotiation up to 3 rounds
	5.	If accepted → transfer to live rep
	6.	Extract outcome + sentiment → POST /call-log

All done using:

	•	AI Extract blocks
	•	Webhook (Call HTTP API) blocks
	•	Condition routing

# 🏗 Tech Stack

	•	FastAPI
	•	Python 3.13
	•	Uvicorn
	•	Fly.io
	•	Docker
	•	HappyRobot AI Platform
	•	JSON load data store

 ```bash 
 fly deploy
 ```

Set secrets( API key)

```bash
fly secrets set API_KEY=dev-api-key
```

start machine

```bash

  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mc_number":"12345"}'
```

Note: test case will need to be added(unit tests, integration test)
