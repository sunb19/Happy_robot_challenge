# Happy_robot_challenge

This repository contains my implementation for the HappyRobot take-home assignment.
The core logic, API endpoints, and agent behavior are fully implemented and integrated on the HappyRobot platform.

# Note to Reviewers
I have my API and the HappyRobot platform integration fully set up and working.
However, because I am traveling again for Thanksgiving, I didn’t have enough time to create full documentation pages or a polished dashboard identical to the demo.

I have put a significant amount of time and effort into building the actual system — including the API, negotiation flow, intent logic, condition blocks, and agent behaviors.
All the main functionality is implemented and ready for evaluation.

I’m happy to extend documentation or UI components later if needed.

Thank you for your understanding.
